# Zap Networking
A very early stage TCP networking library. It employs a traditional server-client architecture. It can currently be applied to simple applications such as a chat program. The code is very simple, and relatively undebugged. The software is not suitable for commercial software use (security reasons.) As per usual, should you decide to use code where my license header appears, please give adequate credit.

### Getting Started
Simply compile the solution with Visual Studio (or your choice of compiler.)

### Prerequisites
